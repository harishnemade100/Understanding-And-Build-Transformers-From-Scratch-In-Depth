# Understanding-And-Build-Transformers-From-Scratch-In-Depth

This project is a **from-scratch implementation of the Transformer architecture** (the model behind GPT, BERT, etc.) in **PyTorch**.  
It is designed to be **educational**: with clear modular files, simple tokenization, and detailed docstrings so even beginners or non-technical readers can follow along.

## 🌟 What is a Transformer?

A Transformer is a neural network model introduced in the famous paper  
["Attention Is All You Need" (Vaswani et al., 2017)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762).  

It changed AI forever because:
- It uses **attention mechanisms** instead of recurrence (RNNs) or convolutions (CNNs).
- It can process entire sentences in parallel (fast!).
- It scales beautifully to large datasets (leading to GPT, BERT, T5, etc.).

In simple terms:
- The **Encoder** reads an input sentence and understands it in context.  
- The **Decoder** uses that context to generate an output sentence (like a translation).

## 📖 How Each Part Works

- **Tokenizer (`tokenization.py`)**  
  Splits sentences into words and maps them to numbers.  
  Example: `"the cat sat"` → `[9, 3, 8]`.

- **Embeddings (`embeddings.py`)**  
  Converts numbers into dense vectors (so words have "meaning").  

- **Positional Encoding (`positional_encoding.py`)**  
  Adds position info (so "the cat sat" ≠ "sat cat the").  

- **Multi-Head Attention (`multi_head_attention.py`)**  
  Each word looks at other words for context. Multiple "heads" = multiple perspectives.  

- **Feed Forward (`feed_forward.py`)**  
  Extra processing for each word representation.  

- **Encoder (`encoder.py`)**  
  Stacks multiple layers to deeply understand the input.  

- **Decoder (`decoder.py`)**  
  Stacks multiple layers that:
  1. Look at past words (masked self-attention).  
  2. Look at the encoder output (cross-attention).  
  3. Generate next word predictions.  

- **Transformer (`transformer.py`)**  
  Full Encoder + Decoder model.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/transformer_project.git
cd transformer_project
2. Install dependencies
bash
Copy code
pip install torch
3. Run Encoder Demo
bash
Copy code
python test_encoder.py
Output will show:

Vocabulary created

Sentence token IDs

Encoder output vectors

Example:

yaml
Copy code
Sentence: "the cat sat on the mat"
Token IDs: [9, 3, 8, 7, 9, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0]
Output shape: torch.Size([1, 10, 32])
4. Run Decoder Demo
bash
Copy code
python test_decoder.py
This simulates a tiny translation:

Input: "the cat sat on the mat"

Target (partial): "le chat s'est ..."

Decoder predicts the next token.

🧪 Example Usage in Code
python
Copy code
import torch
from tokenization import SimpleTokenizer
from transformer import Transformer

# Build toy vocab
src_tok = SimpleTokenizer(["the cat sat on the mat"])
tgt_tok = SimpleTokenizer(["le chat s'est assis sur le tapis"])

# Encode input
src = torch.tensor([[src_tok.encode("the cat sat on the mat", max_len=10)]])
tgt = torch.tensor([[tgt_tok.encode("le chat", max_len=10)]])

# Build model
model = Transformer(src_vocab_size=src_tok.vocab_size(),
                    tgt_vocab_size=tgt_tok.vocab_size(),
                    d_model=32, num_heads=4, dim_ff=64,
                    num_encoder_layers=2, num_decoder_layers=2)

# Forward pass
logits = model(src.squeeze(0), tgt.squeeze(0))
print("Logits shape:", logits.shape)

🛠️ Next Steps
Add a causal mask for proper GPT-like text generation.

Train on a small dataset (e.g., toy English → French).

Build an API endpoint so users can input sentences and get results.

This README is **teaching-focused**, so anyone opening your repo understands:  
- What a Transformer is,  
- Why each file exists,  
- How to run demos,  
- How to extend it into GPT-like projects.

Would you like me to also create a **diagram image** (like encoder → decoder arrows) and add it to the README, so it looks even more professional on GitHub?
